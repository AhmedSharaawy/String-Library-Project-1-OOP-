# clsString – String Class in C++

## Overview

`clsString` is a custom C++ class that groups common string operations into a single, easy-to-use class instead of relying entirely on `std::string`.

This project was built as a practice exercise to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and implement common string algorithms manually.
